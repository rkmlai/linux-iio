Description:
		This property is supported by sensors that have an infrared
		and visible light sensing element. The visible portion is
		usually extracted by subtracting the value from a separate
		infrared only sensor.  Unfortunately this reading is very
		frequency range dependent and hence tends not to have well

Description:
		If known for a device, offset to be added to <type>[Y]_raw prior
		to scaling by <type>[Y]_scale in order to obtain value in the
		<type> units as specified in <type>[y]_raw documentation.
		Not present if the offset is always 0 or unknown. If Y or
		axis <x|y|z> is not present, then the offset applies to all
		in channels of <type>.
		May be writable if a variable offset can be applied on the
		device. Note that this is different to calibbias which
		is for devices (or drivers) that apply offsets to compensate
		for variation between different instances of the part, typically
		adjusted by using some hardware supported calibration procedure.
		Calibbias is applied internally, offset is applied in userspace
		to the _raw output.
